class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        minval=float('inf')
        maxpro=0
        for i in prices:
            if i<minval:
                minval=i
            if i-minval>maxpro:
                maxpro=i-minval
        return maxpro
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
